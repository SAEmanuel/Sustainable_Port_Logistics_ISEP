## Rationale to identify associations between conceptual classes

An association is a relationship between instances of objects that indicates a relevant connection and that is worth of remembering, or it is derivable from the List of Common Associations:

- **_A_** is physically or logically part of **_B_**
- **_A_** is physically or logically contained in/on **_B_**
- **_A_** is a description for **_B_**
- **_A_** known/logged/recorded/reported/captured in **_B_**
- **_A_** uses or manages or owns **_B_**
- **_A_** is related with a transaction (item) of **_B_**
- etc.
    

| Concept (A)       |   Association   |       Concept (B) |
|-------------------|:---------------:|------------------:|
| x                 |      verb       |                 y |

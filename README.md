# Sustainable and Intelligent Port Logistics System


## 1. Description of the Project

The Port Management System is a software solution designed to support the back-office operations of the **Port of Thessaloniki**, one of the main international ports in Greece and a gateway to the Balkans and Southeastern Europe.  
The system enables the management of vessels, docks, storage areas, shipping agent organizations, and vessel visit notifications (VVNs), integrating functionalities across multiple roles (Port Authority Officer, Shipping Agent Representative, Shipping Agent Organization, System Administrator, Staff Member).  

Key features include:  
- **Vessel and Vessel Type Management** (registration, classification, operational constraints).  
- **Dock and Storage Area Management** (capacity, occupancy, assignments).  
- **Shipping Agent Organization and Representative Management** (registration, validation, communication).  
- **Vessel Visit Notification Workflow** (submission, approval/rejection, dock assignment, auditing).  
- **Staff and Resource Allocation** (qualifications, assignments to operations).  

Developed as part of the **5th semester of the Degree in Informatics Engineering (LEI) at ISEP (2025-2026 academic year)**, the project follows a **Scrum methodology** across three sprints, integrating knowledge from five course units: **EAPLI, ESINF, RCOMP, ARQCP, and LAPR5**.

## Project Overview
This project is developed within the scope of the **5th Semester Integrative Project (LEI-ISEP, 2025/26)**.  
The goal is to design and implement a **next-generation information system** to support **sustainable and intelligent port operations**, integrating knowledge from multiple domains such as:
- **Systems Architecture**
- **Systems Administration**
- **Artificial Intelligence**
- **Management and Organizational Analysis**
- **Human-Computer Interaction and Graphics**
- **Software Engineering and Project Management**

The system will be delivered incrementally across **three sprints**, following **agile methodologies (Scrum)**, and will serve as a proof of concept demonstrating:
- Integration of multiple technologies.
- Feasibility of a modular web-based system.
- Application of engineering best practices.
- A solid understanding of the **port logistics domain** and its business context.

## Focus on Thessaloniki Port Authority
For the business analysis component, the team has selected the **Thessaloniki Port Authority (ThPA S.A.)** as the client organization.

Thessaloniki is one of the most important ports in **Southeastern Europe** and a key hub in the **Eastern Mediterranean**. It is strategically located to connect maritime transport with inland trade routes, serving not only Greece but also neighboring countries in the Balkans.

The study of this real-world organization will help us:
- Understand the **operational complexity** of a modern European port.
- Analyze its **organizational structure, mission, vision, and values**.
- Identify its **logistics challenges and opportunities**.
- Ensure our prototype aligns with **real port management practices**.

---

## Project Objectives
The main objectives of the system are to:
- Support the **registration and management** of vessels, docks, storage areas, shipping agents, and logistic resources.
- Enable **planning, scheduling, and monitoring** of vessel visits, including (un)loading operations.
- Provide intelligent support for **dock assignment, task sequencing, and resource allocation**.
- Guarantee **compliance with regulations** (e.g., IMO standards, ISO 6346 container codes, GDPR).
- Offer **visualization and interaction features** for a digital representation of the port.
- Ensure **security, scalability, and resilience** of the system.

---

## Methodology and Approach
- **Development methodology:** Scrum (3 sprints, iterative and incremental delivery).
- **Technological approach:** Modular, web-based prototype integrating management, AI scheduling, and visualization.
- **Best practices:**
    - Version control via GitHub.
    - Issue tracking and milestone planning.
    - Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD).
    - Documentation in alignment with UML and C4 model standards.

---

## Deliverables
- **System Prototype**: Web-based platform with core functionalities.
- **Domain Model**: Representation of entities, attributes, and relationships in the port logistics context.
- **Organizational Analysis** of the Thessaloniki Port Authority (structure, mission, vision, values, SWOT, strategic recommendations).
- **Documentation**: Architecture, API specifications, and project reports.
- **Presentations**: Sprint reviews and final project defense.

---

## Actors and Roles - COMPLETE...
The system will support the following user profiles:
- **Port Authority Officers** – Manage vessels, approve visits, assign docks.
- **Shipping Agent Representatives** – Submit Vessel Visit Notifications and cargo manifests.
- **Logistics Operators** – Schedule and allocate resources for operations.
- **Administrators** – Manage system users, roles, and permissions.

---

## Why Thessaloniki Port?
- It is the **second-largest port in Greece** and one of the oldest in the region.
- Acts as a **gateway to the Balkans** and an important **transshipment hub**.
- Combines **container, bulk, and passenger operations**, offering a diverse logistics environment.
- Provides a **realistic and challenging case study** for port management innovation.

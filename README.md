# Sustainable and Intelligent Port Logistics System

## Project Overview
This project is developed within the scope of the **5th Semester Integrative Project (LEI-ISEP, 2025/26)**.  
The goal is to design and implement a **next-generation information system** to support **sustainable and intelligent port operations**, integrating knowledge from multiple domains such as:
- **Systems Architecture**
- **Systems Administration**
- **Artificial Intelligence**
- **Management and Organizational Analysis**
- **Human-Computer Interaction and Graphics**
- **Software Engineering and Project Management**

The system will be delivered incrementally across **three sprints**, following **agile methodologies (Scrum)**, and will serve as a proof of concept demonstrating:
- Integration of multiple technologies.
- Feasibility of a modular web-based system.
- Application of engineering best practices.
- A solid understanding of the **port logistics domain** and its business context.

## Focus on Thessaloniki Port Authority
For the business analysis component, the team has selected the **Thessaloniki Port Authority (ThPA S.A.)** as the client organization.

Thessaloniki is one of the most important ports in **Southeastern Europe** and a key hub in the **Eastern Mediterranean**. It is strategically located to connect maritime transport with inland trade routes, serving not only Greece but also neighboring countries in the Balkans.

The study of this real-world organization will help us:
- Understand the **operational complexity** of a modern European port.
- Analyze its **organizational structure, mission, vision, and values**.
- Identify its **logistics challenges and opportunities**.
- Ensure our prototype aligns with **real port management practices**.

---

## Project Objectives
The main objectives of the system are to:
- Support the **registration and management** of vessels, docks, storage areas, shipping agents, and logistic resources.
- Enable **planning, scheduling, and monitoring** of vessel visits, including (un)loading operations.
- Provide intelligent support for **dock assignment, task sequencing, and resource allocation**.
- Guarantee **compliance with regulations** (e.g., IMO standards, ISO 6346 container codes, GDPR).
- Offer **visualization and interaction features** for a digital representation of the port.
- Ensure **security, scalability, and resilience** of the system.

---

## Methodology and Approach
- **Development methodology:** Scrum (3 sprints, iterative and incremental delivery).
- **Technological approach:** Modular, web-based prototype integrating management, AI scheduling, and visualization.
- **Best practices:**
    - Version control via GitHub.
    - Issue tracking and milestone planning.
    - Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD).
    - Documentation in alignment with UML and C4 model standards.

---

## Deliverables
- **System Prototype**: Web-based platform with core functionalities.
- **Domain Model**: Representation of entities, attributes, and relationships in the port logistics context.
- **Organizational Analysis** of the Thessaloniki Port Authority (structure, mission, vision, values, SWOT, strategic recommendations).
- **Documentation**: Architecture, API specifications, and project reports.
- **Presentations**: Sprint reviews and final project defense.

---

## Actors and Roles - COMPLETE...
The system will support the following user profiles:
- **Port Authority Officers** – Manage vessels, approve visits, assign docks.
- **Shipping Agent Representatives** – Submit Vessel Visit Notifications and cargo manifests.
- **Logistics Operators** – Schedule and allocate resources for operations.
- **Administrators** – Manage system users, roles, and permissions.

---

## Why Thessaloniki Port?
- It is the **second-largest port in Greece** and one of the oldest in the region.
- Acts as a **gateway to the Balkans** and an important **transshipment hub**.
- Combines **container, bulk, and passenger operations**, offering a diverse logistics environment.
- Provides a **realistic and challenging case study** for port management innovation.

---

## To Do

- [ ] Set up project infrastructure (GitHub repository, issue tracking, CI/CD pipeline).
- [ ] Define/Complete and document the **domain model**.
- [ ] Develop Sprint A functionalities (core registration and management features).
- [ ] Conduct organizational analysis of Thessaloniki Port Authority.
- [ ] Iteratively build and refine the prototype across three sprints.
